# exoplanet-hunt
This is a project to use machine learning in order to search for and identify exoplanets using the data from NASA's Kepler space telescope. In order to keep the data up to date, I'll also do web scraping on their exoplanets website using NASA's API (instead of directly downloading the dataset provided by them, since it's not updated as often).
